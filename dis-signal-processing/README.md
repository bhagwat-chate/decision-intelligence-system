# dis-signal-processing
dis-signal-processing applies multiple deterministic processing stages to transform and interpret incoming signals into decision-ready signal states. It normalizes, classifies, aggregates, and resolves signal precedence to produce structured, traceable outputs that serve as factual inputs for downstream reasoning and decision workflows.
